### 'Chart.js', is great way to get started with charts, uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. how to use it :

1. Setting up

- Copy the Chart.min.js (script link) to your work.
- ` <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>`

2. Drawing a chart

- First thing we need to create a canvas element in our HTML, at end of the body.
  - `<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>`
  - canvas has only two attributes, width and height. And we can add id and class.
  - We can applying CSS to it like colors.

3. Next in js, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:

- ` var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').`<br>`getContext('2d'); ` <br> `new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);`
- Then, create our data
- `var buyerData = {` <br> `labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],` <br>` datasets : [`<br>` {`<br>` fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",`<br>` strokeColor : "#ACC26D",`<br>` pointColor : "#fff",`<br>` pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",`<br>` data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]`<br>` }`<br>` ]`<br>`}`

4. You can change the data as you want, but you should save the structure.

- the "labels" should be an array , the color should be in " " , ...
- You can change the type of the chart as you want , from bars to lines easily if you used other code in 'chart.js' Supports this feature.
