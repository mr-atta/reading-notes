 ## differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|      SQL                            |                  NoSQL                                       |
| --------------------------------    | --------------------------------------------------------     |
|  Relational Databases (RDBMS)       |              non-relational or distributed database          |
|  are table based                    |            are document based, key-value pairs, graph        |
|  have predefined schema             |               have dynamic schema for unstructured data      |
|  vertically scalable                |                  horizontally scalable                       |
|  scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware               |      scaled by increasing the databases servers    |
|  uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data     | UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)  |
|  SQL examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL | UnQL examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb   |
|  good fit for the complex query intensive environment |        not good      |
|  not best fit for hierarchical data storage           |        fits better   |
|  can use               |                       highly preferred for large data set (Hbase )        |
|  For high transactional based application            |            can use                          |
|  Excellent support           |           |
|  emphasizes on ACID properties           |                  follows the Brewers CAP                |
|  open-source or close-sourced            | classified on the basis of way of storing data | 


 ## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  > complex query intensive environment
 ## Give a real world example. 
  >  MySQL
  > Microsoft visual studio, Sql Server ,  gaming
 ## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  > Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema.
 ## Give a real world example.
  > MongoDB
  > companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google 
 ## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  > SQL
 ## Which type of database is best for scalability?
 > MySQL (SQL)

 ## What does SQL stand for?
 > Structured Query Language

 ## What is a realational database?
 > SQL database

 ## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
 > table

 ## What is a â€˜schemaâ€™?
 > is a useful mechanism to segregate database objects for different applications, have filed and each filed have values.

 ## What is a NoSQL database?
 > a database which is employed for managing the massive collection of unstructured data 

 ## Howo does it work?
 > store data in(collections and that each collection has documents  ) rather than relational tables.and no â€˜schemaâ€™ here

 ## What is inside of a Mongo database?
 > stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. 

 ## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
 > MongoDB ensures high and diverse data availability,with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) 
 
 ## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
 > don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases
