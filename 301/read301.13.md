# HTTP Status Code to Use for Every CRUD App

 ## In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
  * 100â€™s = (informational status) header part of the request received, and they will go to transmission demand
  * 200â€™s = (success codes) the request is accepted
  * 300â€™s = (redirection codes) the resource isnâ€™t available at the location
  * 400â€™s = (client error codes) invalid requests 
  * 500â€™s = (the server error codes) with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers 

 ## What is a status code 202?
  > this doesnâ€™t mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending
 ## What is a status code 308?
  > This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. Itâ€™s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but donâ€™t want to implement reading from all of them.
 ## What code would you use if an update didnâ€™t return data to a client?
   > 204 No Content 
 ## What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
  > 410 Gone
 ## What is the â€˜Forbiddenâ€™ status code?
  > 403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesnâ€™t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

# HTTP Status CodesPermalink
* A status code is a number higher than 100 and smaller than 600 that is part of a HTTP response. The first digit defines the class of the status. A status code comes with a reason phrase. The code is for programmatic recognition the phrase is for humans to understand what happened.
