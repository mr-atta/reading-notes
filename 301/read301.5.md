# Thinking In React ü§î



 ### How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy ‚ùì
 > üëâ Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy¬∑
 > üëâ Build A Static Version in React ¬∑
 > üëâ Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State.

 ### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components‚ùì
 * SRP
 *  a computer-programming principle that states that every module, (class or function) should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.
 * a **component** should be only done **one thing**, when finished it will move on. **component**  decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

 ### What does it mean to build a ‚Äòstatic‚Äô version of your application‚ùì
 * That takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. To build a static version of your app that renders your data model.

 ### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
 * You will want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data.

 ### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state‚ùì
 > üëâ Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn‚Äôt state.

 > üëâ Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn‚Äôt state.
 
 > üëâ Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn‚Äôt state.

 ### How can you identify where state needs to live‚ùì
 * Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
 * Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
 * Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
 * If you can‚Äôt find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
