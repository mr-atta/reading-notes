 ## Why don‚Äôt the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
   > Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. 

 ## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  >  Is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
  > That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
  
 ## What does a POST do?
  > The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data. Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only.

 ## What does PUT do?
  > Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
 ## What does PATCH do?
  > A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs.
