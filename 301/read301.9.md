# üìçFunctional Programming Concepts  

 ## What is functional programming ‚ùì
   > FP

   > Functional programming is a programming paradigm ‚Äî a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs ‚Äî that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data .

 ## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function ‚ùì
   > A pure function is a function which: 1.Given the same input, will always return the same output. 2.Produces no side effects.
 ## What are the benefits of a pure function ‚ùì
   * Big advantages to build side-effect-free functions. <hr>  easier to maintain systems. <hr>  easier to read. <hr> we can quickly understand a function.

 ## What is immutability ‚ùì
   > Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
   > When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it‚Äôs created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can‚Äôt. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

 ## What is Referential transparency ‚ùì
   > 'pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency'


# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners 
 > Modules and require()


 ## What is a module‚ùì
   > A module is a file. One script is one module. 

   > Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one.

 ## What does the word ‚Äòrequire‚Äô do‚ùì
 > Global , take a path.

 > The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use it.

 ## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in‚ùì
   >  require('./<name>.path') 

 ## What do we have to do to make a module available‚ùì
   > module.exports=<router>
