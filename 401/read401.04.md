# Readings: Data Modeling

## Q:Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development?

1. Better program design and higher code quality

2. Detailed project documentation

3. TDD reduces the time required for project development

4. TDD reduces the time required for project development

## Q:In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

> Any code, changes on the request and the response objects.
> Finished the request-response cycle. Then call the next middleware you have.

## Q:What is one downside of Test Driven Development?

> actually, this disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time

## Q:What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

> The most important difference is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

## Q:Why REST?

- REST aims to make caching easier
- they provide a great deal of flexibility.
