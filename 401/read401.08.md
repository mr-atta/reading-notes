# Access Control (ACL)

## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization? [📁](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34013299/web-api-authentication-basic-vs-bearer)

- Basic authentication transmits credentials as (user ID/password) **pairs**, _encoded using base64_.
- The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains (Basic word followed by a _space_ and a base64-encoded string) >>>> _username:password_

  > Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==

- Bearer authentication (called token authentication) has security **token**. The “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
- The _client must_ send this token in the **Authorization** header when making requests to protected resources:

  > Authorization: Bearer < token >

## What does the JSON Web Token package do? [📁](https://jwt.io/introduction)

- JSON Web Token (JWT) defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?[📁](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/#ip-whitelist)

- stor it in the dotenv file

- Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories

- Don’t share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems

- use IP whitelisting to prevent any untrusted sources from accessing your GitHub repositories.
