## What is a Stack ‚ùì

- `A stack is a data structure that consists of *Nodes*, Each *Node* references the next Node in the stack.`

- Terminology for a stack is :

  - **Push** , put into the stack are pushed
  - **Pop** , removed from the stack are popped
  - **Top** , top of the stack
  - **Peek** , view the value of the top Node,
  - **IsEmpty** , returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
    > will always be an **O(1)**

* Stacks concepts:

  - **FILO** (First In Last Out)

  - **LIFO** (Last In First Out)

## What is a Queue ‚ùì

- A Queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

  > An example: any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
  > The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.

- Terminology for a queue:

  - **Enqueue** (added)
  - **Dequeue** (removed)
  - **Front** (first Node)
  - **Rear** (last Node)
  - **Peek** (view the value of the front Node)
  - **IsEmpty** ( returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.)
    > will always be an **O(1)**

* Queues concepts:

  - **FILO** (First In Last Out)
  - **LILO** (Last In Last Out)
