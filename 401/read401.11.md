## Why is access control important ❓[📁](https://www.inform-consult.com/why-is-access-control-important/)

- When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

## Describe an application that would need access control ❓

- If you have application and you need to give access to some of the users to do/reach something and the other uses can't.
- Then you will need to use access control to distinguish between the rights of users

## What is a role used for ❓[📁](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/role-based-access-control-rbac/#:~:text=Most%20large%20organizations%20use%20role,need%20to%20do%20their%20jobs.)

- Most large organizations use role-based access control to provide their employees with varying levels of access based on their roles and responsibilities.

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control ❓[📁](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/role-based-access-control-rbac/)

- To most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead.
- ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data.
- while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.
