# Event Driven Architecture

<br><hr>

> **Event-driven architecture** (_EDA_) is a software design pattern that enables an organization to detect ‚Äúevents‚Äù or important business moments

## What‚Äôs the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue ‚ùì [üìÅ](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-sqs-standard-and-fifo-first-in-first-out-queues-28d1ea5e153#:~:text=Standard%20queues%20guarantee%20that%20a,not%20introduced%20into%20the%20queue.)

> **Standard queues** guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue.
> **FIFO queues** ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it; duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received ‚ùì

## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming ‚ùì [üìÅ](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-event-driven-design-patterns-for-microservices-659b3c9fb51f)

> Event Notification , It is the most basic pattern describing event-centric communication facilitated by the Event Store.

## How do you test an event driven system ‚ùì [üìÅ](https://medium.com/dan-on-coding/testing-event-driven-systems-63c6b0c57517)

> **Unit Tests** are the most basic tests you will write
> Your unit test will interact with this class directly, passing various Order values to it, and verifying the tax has been calculated properly.

> Service Tests These tests verify the contract of services, that is given certain inputs, the service produces a certain output.

- Events have two primary functions:
  1. They are triggers of side effects somewhere in the system.
  2. They are also carriers of arbitrary data.

## SNS

- simple _notification_ services.
- publisher/subsicriber system.
- publish a message about some topic, then will be delivered to many subsicribers with diffrent types.

## SQS

- simple _queue_ service.
- queueing service for message processing.
- the system must poll the queue to discover a new event.
- processing in the queue will be for single consumer.
