# Review, Research, and Discussion

## Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle❓ [📁](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/request-response-cycle-static)

> The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.<br>
> The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Is a useful guide to see how all the app’s files and folders fit together.

## Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC❓

> A server program awaits and achieves requests from client programs, which might be running in the same, or other computers. application in a computer might function as a client with requests for services from other programs and as a server of requests from other programs.

## What does it mean to “deploy” an application❓ [📁](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/software-deployment/)

- **Software Deployment**

  > Software deployment includes all of the steps, processes, and activities that are required to make a software system or update available to its intended users. <br>
  > Some of the most common activities of software deployment include software release, installation, testing, deployment, and performance monitoring.

### What is a **client**?

> A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server. Generally, clients are web browsers (like Chrome or Firefox), but clients can also be API’s making requests to another server.

### What is an **HTTP request**?

> A HTTP request is a text string generated by the client and sent to the server containing the specifications of the resource the client is asking for. A resource is anything that can accessed via the web.

## What is a Virtual Machine (vm) ❓

- a computer system created using software on one physical computer in order to emulate the functionality of another separate physical computer.
- It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed.
- called a _hypervisor_

- some virtual machine **_examples_** :
  - VirtualBox
  - Virtual Iron
  - Oracle VM
  - Virtual PC
  - Virtual Server
  - Mac
- some virtual machine **_uses_** :
  1.  Saving Data From a Legacy System.
  2.  Testing a New Operating System or Software.

## **_Cloud_** computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. [📁](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) <br>

## **_Virtualization_** computing uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). [📁](<https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtualization-a-complete-guide#:~:text=Virtualization%20uses%20software%20to%20create,called%20virtual%20machines%20(VMs).>) <br>

## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. <br>

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS. <br>
