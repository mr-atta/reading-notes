# Review, Research, and Discussion

## Describe “The Cloud”❓ [📁](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)

> **"The cloud"** refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world.

## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)❓[📁](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container#:~:text=A%20container%20is%20a%20standard,one%20computing%20environment%20to%20another.&text=Available%20for%20both%20Linux%20and,same%2C%20regardless%20of%20the%20infrastructure.)

> A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## What is auto-scaling❓ [📁](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)

> **AWS Auto Scaling** lets you set target utilization levels for multiple resources in a single, intuitive interface. You can quickly see the average utilization of all of your scalable resources without having to navigate to other consoles. For example, if your application uses Amazon EC2 and Amazon DynamoDB, you can use AWS Auto Scaling to manage resource provisioning for all of the EC2 Auto Scaling groups and database tables in your application.

## What is bandwidth❓ [📁](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bandwidth.asp)

> **Bandwidth** is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person's capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time.

## How do cloud providers compute service costs❓ [📁]()

> Cloud providers determine the expense to maintain the network.<br>
> They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.<br>
> These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its cloud.<br>

  - Query-in-place and process on-request
  - Most supported cloud storage services

* Use cases like :
  - Backup and restore
  - Disaster recovery (DR)
  - Data lakes and big data analytics

## What is AWS Lambda?

- AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services.
- The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

## CDN

- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, and images.

- A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.
