## Review, Research, and Discussion

## How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS❓ [📁](https://dev.to/afrazchelsea/react-vs-vanilla-js-what-why-and-when-1jin#:~:text=React%20breaks%20down%20the%20UI,an%20edge%20over%20Vanilla%20JS.&text=This%20is%20where%20React%20comes,to%20bypass%20the%20manual%20work.)

- React breaks down the UI into smaller and reusable components that can move around data amongst each other.

* Vanilla JS initially renders the UI anywhere from 5-10x faster than Preact, and about 30x faster than React!

## What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component❓ [📁]()

### Why Hooks?

- However, we often can’t break complex components down any further because the logic is stateful and can’t be extracted to a function or another component.

### very common ases:

1. **Huge components** that are hard to refactor and test.
2. **Duplicated logic** between different components and lifecycle methods.
3. **Complex patterns** like render props and higher-order components.

### **_Hooks_** are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Basic Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext

## Additional Hooks

- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRef
- useImperativeHandle
- useLayoutEffect
- useDebugValue
