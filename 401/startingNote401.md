# Solving Problems üí¢

1‚É£ The most common mistake when someone tries to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code ASAP.

> make sure to take enough time to think before starting code.

2‚É£Ô∏è Another mistake is trying to solve all the problems the first time.

> Just broke the big problem into pieces (small problems).

## Simple steps for any algorithm-type programming problem:

1.  Read the problem completely twice
    > most important step
2.  Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3.  Optimize the manual steps.
4.  Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5.  Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6.  Optimize the real code.

# How to think like a programmer

### WHYü§î ??

- Because it‚Äôs the more effective way for problem-solving.

### HOWü§î ??

- The best way involves : a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

- Here are the steps:
  1. Understand
  - Most hard problems are hard because you don‚Äôt understand them.
  - When you can explain the problem in plain, you understood it.
  - you should _write_ down your problem, doodle a _diagram_, or _tell_ someone else about it.

2.  Plan

- 'In programming, this means don‚Äôt start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information'

3.  Divide

- it's important step
- break (one big problem) into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

4.  If Stuck ?

- here are three things to try when you stuck :

  - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. (debugging)
  - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
  - Research: No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution.

- Practice to get the experience.

## Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

#### How to Use the 5 Whys (seven-step)

1.  Assemble a Team

- Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2.  Define the Problem

- Discuss it with your team
- write a brief
- clear problem statement that you all agree with it

3.  Ask the First "Why?"

- many questions (Why's)

4.  Ask "Why?" Four More Times

- For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession.

5.  Know When to Stop

- you may reach this point before you ask your fifth "Why?" If you do, make sure that you haven't stopped too soon
- The important point is to stop asking "Why?" when you stop producing useful responses.

6. Address the Root Cause(s)

- you need to discuss and find the solutions for the problem.

7. Monitor Your Measures

- keep watching

# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You‚Äôll Become 100x More Productive

- 'You have very few hours here on on this earth.'

### Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000 , What would your life look like ??

- ‚ÄúBeing _busy_ is a form of mental laziness.‚Äù -Tim Ferriss
  > It takes _discipline_ to not become ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù
