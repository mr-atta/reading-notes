## First:
Languages are often used for programming websites
* html : * Adds basic structure and                     structure to the code *
* css : * Improved page appearance *
* Javascripit : * To change behavior and add                    interaction *

###### css and js they can be kept in separate files. This gives us ease and speed of use.

## Then CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT
- create folder with .js 
- you can add css folder 
- mention js file in html before close the     body
- write your code in js
- you should see the "inspect" button when click right-clicks on any website and see the change in "console".
- you must be a regulator at any code you working on 
###### see  &#9196; ![Js code](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zP8R2.png)
