## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
###### 4 things Makes a Computer, a Computer is :
- Input - Storage - Processing - Output 
> beside electrical components " circuits "

* Computer is tool make to solve problems.
* Input is What you do in your mouse,keyboard,microphone,...
* Computer Storage Input in memories.
* Output depends on what the computer design to do.

## Binary(0,1) & Data
* Computers Work on '1' and '0' , by waier and circuits.

| 1  | 0   |
|--- |---  |
|on  |off  |
|yes |no   |
|true|fales|
* one of this signale called a Bit.

######  System
> there are 10 number from 0 to 9 .

* in Binary or Decimal each position have value:

> with more Bits/waiers you can git big number.

* also characters have a value.
* and photo have a very small pieces called Pixels(color),can represente with 0,1.

- every Input or Output is type of data
