# Operators and Loops
# Operators
### The evaluates be by comparing value, the result will be true or false (in comparison or logical).
* We have :
  - '=='
  - '!='
  - '!=='
  - '==='
  - '<'
  - '>'
  - '<='
  - '>='
* The priority of parentheses must be observed'()'
* from left to right
### AND , OR , not
>like: (var == '1' && var < '10')

## Loops
![loop](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/loop-logo-vector-ribbon-lettering-260nw-1425991553.jpg)
* It works on checking the condition if it is true entry into the block.
* type of loops:
  - for 
  - while
  - do  while

## for
* when you have a specific number of runs.
* The most common.
* The counter(var) often starts at zero.
* Every time one counter increases.
* When the condition becomes "f" out of the block.

## while 
* The meter usually starts with 1.
* The increase over the counter is in the block.
* Statement 1: '= +' Used to add new content to var 'msg' every run.
* Statement 2: Increase counter variable by 1.
## Make sure not to fall into a trap of the infinity loop.&#127773;
