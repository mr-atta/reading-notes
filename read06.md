## * WHAT IS A FUNCTION? *
> Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

* we ** call ** the function when we want it to make the sentences.
* When we want the Function to be flexible, we use the **parameters**.
* When we want the return something to use, we use the **Return**.

## Declaring a function
