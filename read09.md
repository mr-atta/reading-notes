# ***  A Text Editor. ***
 ## * What is a text editor? *
 * A text editor is a piece of software that  you download and install on
  your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
  allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
  to build a web site.
* The text editor has to be one of the most
  important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
# *Which Text Editor is the best one? *
 * Any Text Editor will do the job and get     it   done.
 * You can choose the program that you like     and love because all are very similar.

## ** The most important features **
  * code completion
  > The greatest feature  is code completion,  will display possible suggestions based    on what you originally typed.


  * A nice variety of themes 
  > To reduce eye strain and fatigue

  * the ability to choose from a healthy     selection of extensions

## ** Another  features to write your HTML         and CSS more efficiently**

 * Emmet
  > speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
 * syntax highlighting
  >Syntax highlighting is a feature that   takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it.

### Every computer will come with its own text editor.
- On Mac computers, is called,
“Text Edit.”
- On Windows computers, is called,
  “Notepad.”
*  ** Since these text editors already come   on your computers, why should
 you download another text editor ? **

* If you want to using the text editors that come with your computer **!!**
 there’s a couple of caveats that I’d like to make you aware of:
   * no need to bold,underline or italicize code.
   * make sure, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere to store your entire website.
   * as important as the extension (the “.html” and the “.css”).
## There are some programs available.
* like:
  * Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom.

    * Each of these titles does have some if not all of the features that we talked about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are widely used in web development today.

# The Command Line!
  * A command line (terminal) is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
 
* Opening a Terminal
  * Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different.
  
* The Shell (Bash)
  * This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. 
  * If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo 
* Shortcuts , to make your life easier.

* So where are we?  **pwd**
* What's in Our Current Location?  **ls**
 > ls [options] 
* Absolute and Relative Paths **absolute** and **relative**
* Move Around a Bit  **cd ** 
 > cd
* Quotes    **'' **
